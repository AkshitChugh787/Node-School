# Node-School
These are in-person hosted workshops, usually free, in which workshoppers are used as curriculum and mentors help attendees work through the challenges.
You’ll need Node.js on your computer to get started with each of these. Then use npm (it comes with Node) to install each module with the command below it. Once installed, simply type the workshopper’s name to launch.

You will also need a Text Editor, if you don't have one already, you may want one for editing code. A few options: Atom, Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Brackets.
